- Big scrollytelling thing - shows me doing awesome stuff, coding, building with a focus on what I can do now. The purpose is to make me look cool
  - Needs to have a section with 8 claude codes
  - Ultra clean design, with a clear design language (orange accesnts)
- Unsure; Need to figure out how to do assets / scrollytelling thing. Will I use a lib or rawdog it?
- Blog posts must be ultra clean, ultra lean and informative. 
  - Need to pair them with the youtube video and display it nicely
  - Embeds of x.com content
  - ultra rich github embeds
- Ultra nice project pages 
  - Over the top visuals, with preview animations on hover. on mobile, they should move with acceleromoeter
  - Config driven, I can add them from my github - link to both code and live site. If not open source, just live site I guess. or maybe youtube video
  - Don't care if it's driven by the ghost editor for a custom type, or if we have to do it manually 
- Similar to projects, dev zone where I can throw things that are being tried out
 - I want a dev playground, all my .dev projects can live there

Needs to have a "WOW" when you first see it - maybe inspired by lando norris' page. Probably like 120fps at least full webgl type rendering.
Theme shouldbe desert, I love the Australian desert (and Australian outdoors in general) so want to go with the nature theme.

Blog needs to mainly funnel to my key projects that I'm working on. and demonstrate my ability to do stuff. 

What should the scrollytelling have? Probably needs to actually make sense though. 
- Should have an actively typing keyboard on the link to x.com
- Should have an actual playing youtube video from one of my recent videos (ideally, with 3d effect. We can fake it or make it real and have it clickable as an embed)
- The story can include an intro to what I do - cover each aspect. Writing code / github. Mostly working on software at big australian companies, consulting and the like
- Show me doing talks

I guess it's clear my page is ME it's about ME and I'm essentially showing off what ME means to YOU and if you find something cool, you're in the funnel. 

Success criteria:
1. Wow design factor
2. Fast
3. Converts to talks
4. Converts to my main projects
5. Converts to my articles? -> need to expand on this - do I show top articles (yes) -- Like DHH, I don't want paid pressure to write and poast
6. Convert to twitter somehow / youtube / linkedin

Scenarios:
- Recruiter sees it -> Oh wow programmer cool, gets routed appropriately
- Talk organiser sees it -> Here is the SKILZ
- Client / someone sees this -> Oh can this guy build his way aound this thing and fix it?
- Person who heard of my xyz dev project -> Finds it quickly

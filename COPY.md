# Brand Rebrand Copy - January 2026

## Brand Voice
- Outback-coded, unconventional, goes DEEP into weird areas
- "Just does things" energy - ships constantly
- Warm but slightly unhinged
- Vagueposting mystique (intrigue > résumé)
- Enterprise-scale experience worn lightly

## 8 Claude Codes

**Label:** 8 Claude Codes
**Title:** What I'm Building Right Now
**Description:** One agent writes specs. Three implement. Two research. One reviews. One deploys. It mostly works. I'm figuring out the rest live.

**Animation notes:** Text types out character by character. Input prompt ($ command) appears on only 1 terminal at a time. All 8 show activity but focus rotates. Massive loop - never stops. Convey active chaos of wrangling 8 agents.

## Case Studies (under The Builder)

Keep vague but compelling. Current three:
1. Healthcare Insights → AWS Innovation Centre
2. Enterprise Data Silos → Modern Data Platforms
3. Remote Education → Interactive Learning Platform

Could simplify to just the tagline: "Banks, hospitals, schools, government. Big migrations, bigger architectures."

The `\u003ch1 class=\"post-title\"\u003e` element is present but empty.\n\n### Observed Behavior\n- Homepage post cards show titles correctly (index.hbs works)\n- Post page tab title shows correctly (\"Coming soon\")\n- Post page h1 is empty: `\u003ch1 class=\"post-title\"\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e`\n- `{{title}}` helper outputs nothing in post.hbs context\n\n### Expected Behavior\nPost title should render in the h1 on post pages.\n\n### Template Code (post.hbs:5)\n```handlebars\n\u003ch1 class=\"post-title\"\u003e{{title}}\u003c/h1\u003e\n```\n\n### Investigation Notes\n- Date helper `{{date}}` works correctly in same template\n- Post context appears to be available (date renders)\n- Restarting Ghost did not resolve\n- Not a CSS issue (element exists, just empty)\n\n### Possible Causes\n1. Ghost theme context issue\n2. Template inheritance problem with `{{!\u003c default}}`\n3. Ghost caching edge case\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Post titles render on post pages\n- [ ] Verified working after Ghost restart","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"cdilga@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-23T08:56:06.905969+10:00","created_by":"Chris Dilger","updated_at":"2026-01-23T21:35:58.98837+10:00","closed_at":"2026-01-23T21:35:58.98837+10:00","close_reason":"Bug already fixed in commit 92ca3ad.

{"id":"ghost-blog-02t","title":"Asset: Preprocess Triton navbar icons (trim alpha)","description":"Preprocess all 4 Triton icon variants to trim excess alpha padding around edges.\n\n## Context\nThe Section Nav system (see LANDING_PAGE_SKETCH.md \u003e Section Navigation System) uses Triton ute icons as the 'you are here' indicator. The icons have excess transparent padding that needs trimming for proper alignment and sizing in the nav.\n\n## Assets to Process\nLocated in `example_static_assets/`:\n- `triton-up-navbar-icon.png` - Desktop: scrolling down (forward)\n- `triton-down-navbar-icon.png` - Desktop: scrolling up (back)\n- `triton-left-navbar-icon.png` - Mobile: scrolling up (back)\n- `triton-right-navbar-icon.png` - Mobile: scrolling down (forward)\n\n## Requirements\n1. Trim transparent padding to tight bounding box around the icon\n2. Maintain consistent sizing across all 4 variants (same dimensions)\n3. Keep PNG format with transparency\n4. Output to theme assets directory (themes/chris-theme/assets/images/nav/)\n5. Consider generating multiple sizes (@1x, @2x) for retina\n\n## Visual Check Required\nAfter preprocessing, visually verify:\n- Icons align correctly when swapped (morph transition)\n- No visual artifacts from alpha trimming\n- Consistent apparent size across all variants\n- Clean edges suitable for glassmorphism overlay\n\n## Behavior Reference (from spec)\n- Desktop: Triton morphs between up/down based on scroll direction\n- Mobile: Triton uses left/right (horizontal scroll metaphor)\n- Movement is subtle (single-pixel movements within section slot)\n- May be replaced with simple circle if too complex - keep that fallback in mind\n\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] All 4 icons trimmed to tight bounding box\n- [ ] Consistent dimensions across variants\n- [ ] Visual check confirms clean alignment\n- [ ] Icons copied to theme assets directory\n- [ ] Optional: @2x retina versions generated","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"cdilga@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-25T20:08:42.744036+10:00","created_by":"Chris Dilger","updated_at":"2026-01-26T12:08:45.855228+10:00","closed_at":"2026-01-26T12:08:45.855228+10:00","close_reason":"Icons verified satisfactory in main worktree.

{"id":"ghost-blog-kl4","title":"Design: Thin line section icons for glassmorphism nav","description":"Design 8 minimal thin-line icons for the section navigation sidebar.\n\n## Context\nThe Section Nav system (see LANDING_PAGE_SKETCH.md \u003e Section Navigation System) requires custom icons for each landing page section. Icons must match the glassmorphism aesthetic - thin, elegant, consistent stroke weight.\n\n## Design Requirements\n- **Style**: Minimal line-based, thin strokes (think Apple SF Symbols thin weight)\n- **Consistency**: Same stroke weight across all icons (suggest 1.5-2px)\n- **Format**: SVG for crisp scaling, with PNG fallbacks\n- **Colors**: Single color (will be styled via CSS for hover states)\n- **Size**: Design at 24x24px base, scalable\n\n## Sections \u0026 Icon Concepts (from spec)\n\n| Section | Icon Concept | Notes |\n|---------|-------------|-------|\n| The Coder | Code brackets `\u003c/\u003e` or terminal cursor `▋` | Developer identity |\n| 8 Claude Codes | Grid of 8 small squares or mini terminal windows | Represents multiple agents |\n| Content Creator | Play triangle `▷` or video camera outline | YouTube/video focus |\n| The Speaker | Microphone outline or podium | Public speaking |\n| The Consultant | Building outline or briefcase | Enterprise/business |\n| The Teacher | Graduation cap or chalkboard | Education/mentoring |\n| Projects | Diamond/gem `◇` or folder outline | Portfolio work |\n| All My Writing | Document with lines or pen/pencil | Blog/articles |\n\n## Behavior Context\n- Icons sit in glassmorphism sidebar (low opacity background)\n- On hover: icon expands smoothly to reveal full section title\n- Must be recognizable at small sizes (~20-24px)\n- Glass textures allow background to show through - icons need good contrast\n\n## Deliverables\n1. 8 SVG icons (one per section)\n2. PNG exports at @1x and @2x\n3. Icons placed in `themes/chris-theme/assets/images/nav/`\n4. CSS sprite or individual files (individual preferred for flexibility)\n\n## Design Inspiration\n- Apple SF Symbols (thin weight)\n- Phosphor Icons (thin variant)\n- Lucide Icons\n- Keep it simpler than these - even more minimal\n\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] 8 icons designed with consistent stroke weight\n- [ ] SVG format with clean paths\n- [ ] PNG fallbacks generated\n- [ ] Icons recognizable at 20-24px\n- [ ] Visual test in glassmorphism context (backdrop-filter blur)\n- [ ] Icons work in both light and dark contexts (single color, CSS-stylable)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"cdilga@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-25T20:08:44.921233+10:00","created_by":"Chris Dilger","updated_at":"2026-01-26T11:55:48.769463+10:00","closed_at":"2026-01-26T11:55:48.769463+10:00","close_reason":"All 8 section icons designed and tested: coder (\u003c/\u003e), claude-codes (8 grid), content-creator (play), speaker (mic), consultant (building), teacher (cap), projects (gem), writing (doc).

{"id":"ghost-blog-w7t","title":"Scene: All My Writing - Projection Carousel with Windswept Background","description":"# All My Writing - Projection Slide Carousel\n\nReimagine the blog carousel as a **legacy projection slide wheel** with the windswept video as an atmospheric backdrop.\n\n## Visual Concept\n\n### Carousel Design\n- **Style**: Classic slide projector carousel aesthetic (like Kodak Carousel)\n- **Two axes**: One carousel on X-axis, one on Y-axis\n- **No Z-axis**: Flat, 2D movement only - no depth/perspective transforms\n- **Cards**: Article cards arranged like slides in a circular carousel wheel\n\n### Background\n- **Windswept video ONLY**: Full-bleed behind the carousel section\n- **Remove scroll-capture video**: The video-of-site-scrolling makes no sense on the site itself\n- **Tasteful overlap**: Video visible through/around the carousel elements\n- **Blend**: Subtle transparency or cutouts letting the video atmosphere through\n\n### Interaction\n- Horizontal carousel: scroll/swipe left-right\n- Vertical carousel: scroll/swipe up-down\n- Smooth, mechanical feel like advancing slides\n\n## Technical Changes\n1. Move windswept video from `blog-showcase-footer` INTO `carousel-section` as background\n2. **DELETE scroll-capture video entirely** (keep file for external promo use only)\n3. Remove the separate `blog-showcase-footer` section\n4.
